**Power BI Projects Portfolio**

**Welcome to my Power BI Projects Portfolio!**

This repository is a showcase of my ability to leverage Power BI for data visualization and analysis, highlighting my expertise in transforming data into actionable insights.

**Purpose**

This portfolio is designed to exhibit my skills in data visualization, analysis, and business intelligence through Power BI. It features projects that demonstrate my proficiency in data cleaning, modeling, and creating comprehensive dashboards.

**Projects Overview**

_**Data Professional Survey Breakdown**_: This project involved meticulous data cleaning and modeling to analyze survey data on various job-related outcomes and demographics. I crafted a Power BI Dashboard to highlight key points, utilizing gauges, clustered charts, doughnut graphs, cards, a tree map, and bar charts. The dashboard effectively visualizes participant happiness with certain job aspects, participant sex, job titles, country of residence, and more, providing a multifaceted view of the data professional landscape.

_**Grad Program Data**_: This project involved meticulous data cleaning and modeling to analyze survey data on student program outcome data using data from a research program in a public university. The outcomes that were looked at were ethnicity, gender, program type, graduate school acceptances, and college type. The visualization was presented to key stakeholders such as college President, Provost, and College Deans to showcase the successful utilization of the $14 million NIH grant over the past decade. Outcomes show the success of the program and meeting proposed goals to increase diversity in the biomedical and behavioral fields of study. Utilized Power Query to import and clean data sets from Excel, merging and appending queries, implemented DAX functions for statistical calculations on merged datasets, and pivoted columns to streamline data processing workflow. The data revealed that students who completed our two-year program were 50% more likely to be accepted into a graduate program. 

**About Me**

I am a dedicated Data Analyst with a rich background in psychology, bringing a unique perspective to data analysis and visualization. My work at California State University Long Beach and previous roles have honed my skills in statistical analysis, data management, and making data-driven decisions.
