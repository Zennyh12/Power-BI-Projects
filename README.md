**Power BI Projects Portfolio**

**Welcome to my Power BI Projects Portfolio!**

This repository is a showcase of my ability to leverage Power BI for data visualization and analysis, highlighting my expertise in transforming data into actionable insights.

**Purpose**

This portfolio is designed to exhibit my skills in data visualization, analysis, and business intelligence through Power BI. It features projects that demonstrate my proficiency in data cleaning, modeling, and creating comprehensive dashboards.

**Projects Overview**

_**Data Professional Survey Breakdown**_: This project involved meticulous data cleaning and modeling to analyze survey data on various job-related outcomes and demographics. I crafted a Power BI Dashboard to highlight key points, utilizing gauges, clustered charts, doughnut graphs, cards, a tree map, and bar charts. The dashboard effectively visualizes participant happiness with certain job aspects, participant sex, job titles, country of residence, and more, providing a multifaceted view of the data professional landscape.

**About Me**

I am a dedicated Data Analyst with a rich background in psychology, bringing a unique perspective to data analysis and visualization. My work at California State University Long Beach and previous roles have honed my skills in statistical analysis, data management, and making data-driven decisions.
